## Guidelines for commiting to the `master` branch:
* master branch is the main and important branch, therefore, it is crucial to exercise caution and consider certain factors before committing changes to it.
* Make sure that your code works perfectly without any errors
* Discuss with your teammates before commiting anything to the master branch
* Be sure to add your dependencies, required libraries to the requirements.txt
* Whenever you commit, Mention clearly what change has been done, Why it has been done, What does it actually fix or what new feature does it add in. You can also write the test cases that you're sure about.

## Tips for commiting:

* Be descriptive: Use concise and descriptive titles that summarize the purpose of the commit. Avoid vague or generic titles that don't provide enough context.

* Use the imperative mood: Start the commit message with an imperative verb, such as "Add," "Fix," "Update," or "Refactor." This conveys the action performed by the commit and makes it easier to understand at a glance.

* Keep it concise: Try to keep your commit names short and to the point, ideally around 50 characters or less. Long commit names can be difficult to read and may get truncated in certain interfaces.

* Focus on the why, not just the what: Apart from stating what you did, also provide a brief explanation of why the change was made. This helps future developers understand the rationale behind the code modifications.

* Use present tense: Write commit names in the present tense, as if you're giving a command. For example, "Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug" or "Fixing bug."

* Separate subject from the body: If your commit message requires more explanation, use a blank line after the subject line and provide a more detailed description in the body. The body should be wrapped at 72 characters per line.

* Be consistent: Establish a consistent naming convention within your team or project to make it easier to understand commit messages and maintain a uniform style. Consistency helps with readability and searchability.

* Reference relevant issues: If your commit is related to an issue or ticket in a project management system or bug tracker, include a reference to it in the commit message. For example, "Fix bug #123" or "Implement feature (Issue #456)."

* Proofread and double-check: Before committing your changes, take a moment to review your commit message for any typos or grammatical errors. A well-written message demonstrates professionalism and attention to detail.

* Avoid unnecessary details: While it's important to be descriptive, refrain from including excessive or irrelevant information in your commit messages. Stick to the essential details that convey the purpose of the commit.

## How to commit?
* Please be noted that, No one is allowed to commit directly to the `master` branch.
* You can push your code directly to your own branch

1. Initialize your repo (Do this only when you're uploading your code to the GitHub for the first time)
```bash
git init
```
2. Adding required files
```bash
git add <location-of-your-file-to-add>
```

3. Commiting your changes
```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message here"

# We can even write multi-line commit names
#Example:
git commit -m "Fix unable to login: fixed an issue unable to login
* There seems to be an issue with login.py, The variable was not declared." 
```

4. Pushing your changes to the GitHub:
```bash
git push HEAD:<branch-name>
```

## FAQs
* How can I create a branch?

```bash
git branch -M <branch-name>
```

* How can I delete a commit?

You can delete a commit but this is one of the dangerous tasks & it is not recommended. Make sure to ask DevOps specialist in your team.

* How can I edit my commit?

You can refer to `git rebase`, Check git documentation for that
